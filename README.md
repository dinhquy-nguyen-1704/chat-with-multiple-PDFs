# chat-with-multiple-PDFs
## 1. Introduction
This GitHub repository provides a friendly chat interface that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Ensemble Retriever technique. It is engineered to not only summarize but also facilitate Q&A interactions with the content of user-uploaded PDFs using Langchain framework. The system showcases the integration of advanced NLP techniques within a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing for an interactive exploration of PDF contents.

## 2. How to use?
### Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/dinhquy-nguyen-1704/chat-with-multiple-PDFs.git
cd chat-with-multiple-PDFs
```
```
conda create -n chat-with-multiple-PDFs python=3.9.6
conda activate chat-with-multiple-PDFs
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Using Streamlit
Add the OpenAI API KEY in the **.env** file.
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```
Then, you can run the **app.py** file and a Streamlit interface will appear.
```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
> I have prepared a Vietnamese PDF file in the **sample** folder for you to test.
### Run on Colab
I have also provided you with a Google Colab Notebook for the convenience of running code, you just need to replace your OPEN AI API in the .env file.
