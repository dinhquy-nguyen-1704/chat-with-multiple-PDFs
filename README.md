# chat-with-multiple-PDFs
## 1. Introduction
Building a chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Ensemble Retriever technique. It is engineered not only to summarize but also to facilitate Q&A interactions with the content of user-uploaded PDFs using the Langchain framework through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

### Using Streamlit
Add the OpenAI API KEY in the **.env** file.
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

### Run on Colab
I have also provided you with a Google Colab Notebook for the convenience of running code, you just need to replace your OPEN_AI_API in the .env file.
